DEVOPS AND EVOLUTION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT:


        DevOps (AWS):

            - DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools
              that increases an organization's ability to deliver applications and services at hight velocity.


                        increase - увеличение
                        ability  - способность
                        velocity - скорость


        DevOps (L. Leite)

            - DevOps is collaborative and multidisciplinary effort within an organization to automate
              continuos delivery of new software versions while guaranteeing their correctness and reliability.


                        collaborative - коллективный
                        effort        - усилие
                        within        - внутри, в рамках
                        reliability   - надежность


        DevOps (Gene Kim - The DevOps Handbook)


            - DevOps is the outcome of applying the most trusted principles from the domain
              of physical manufacturing and leadership to the IT value stream.


                        outcome - итог



        - The result is world-class reliability, stability, and secutity at ever lower cost and effort;
          and accelerated flow and reliability through the technology value stream, including 
          Product Management, Development, QA, IT Operations and Infosec;


                        accelarated flow - ускоренный поток
                        evolved          - развитый



        WATERFALL MODEL:


            - Requirements
            - Design
            - Implementation
            - Testing
            - Deployment


                        enhanced  - улучшенный
                        essential - существенный
                        sufficient - достаточно

        TEAMS:

            - Business
            - Development
            - Opeations


    => 3 key elements to developing great software:

            - Enhanced communication
            - Automation
            - Quick feedback




EVOLUTION TO AGILE:


        - Agile brought the business  and the development teams together into ome team;

        - Sprints - Small Iterations

            - The teams worked together to build great software in small iterations, called
              sprints, instead of spending  weeks or months.

        - Agile Automation:

            - Code Commit 
            - Unit Tests
            - Code Quality
            - Package
            - Integration Tests



DEVOPS:


    - The  focus of DevOps is on enhancing the communications between the development and operations.
